		{"name":"When most I wink, then do mine eyes best see,","value":1},
		{"name":"For all the day they view things unrespected;","value":1},

		{"name":"When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade","value":1},
		{"name":"Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay!","value":1},
		{"name":"All days are nights to see till I see thee,","value":1},
		{"name":"And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me.","value":1},
		{"name":"If the dull substance of my flesh were thought,","value":1},
		{"name":"Injurious distance should not stop my way;","value":1},
		{"name":"For then despite of space I would be brought,","value":1},
		{"name":"From limits far remote, where thou dost stay.","value":1},
		{"name":"No matter then although my foot did stand","value":1},
		{"name":"Upon the farthest earth remov'd from thee;","value":1},
		{"name":"For nimble thought can jump both sea and land,","value":1},
		{"name":"As soon as think the place where he would be.","value":1},
		{"name":"But, ah! thought kills me that I am not thought,","value":1},
		{"name":"To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone,","value":1},
		{"name":"But that so much of earth and water wrought,","value":1},
		{"name":"I must attend time's leisure with my moan;","value":1},
		{"name":"Receiving nought by elements so slow","value":1},
		{"name":"But heavy tears, badges of either's woe.","value":1},
		{"name":"The other two, slight air, and purging fire","value":1},
		{"name":"Are both with thee, wherever I abide;","value":1},
		{"name":"The first my thought, the other my desire,","value":1},
		{"name":"These present-absent with swift motion slide.","value":1},
		{"name":"For when these quicker elements are gone","value":1},
		{"name":"In tender embassy of love to thee,","value":1},
		{"name":"My life, being made of four, with two alone","value":1},
		{"name":"Sinks down to death, oppress'd with melancholy;","value":1},
		{"name":"Until life's composition be recur'd","value":1},
		{"name":"By those swift messengers return'd from thee,","value":1},
		{"name":"Who even but now come back again, assur'd,","value":1},
		{"name":"Of thy fair health, recounting it to me:","value":1},
		{"name":"This told, I joy; but then no longer glad,","value":1},
		{"name":"I send them back again, and straight grow sad.","value":1},
		{"name":"Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war,","value":1},
		{"name":"How to divide the conquest of thy sight;","value":1},
		{"name":"Mine eye my heart thy picture's sight would bar,","value":1},
		{"name":"My heart mine eye the freedom of that right.","value":1},
		{"name":"My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie,--","value":1},
		{"name":"A closet never pierc'd with crystal eyes--","value":1},
		{"name":"But the defendant doth that plea deny,","value":1},
		{"name":"And says in him thy fair appearance lies.","value":1},
		{"name":"To side this title is impannelled","value":1},
		{"name":"A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart;","value":1},
		{"name":"And by their verdict is determined","value":1},
		{"name":"The clear eye's moiety, and the dear heart's part:","value":1},
		{"name":"As thus; mine eye's due is thy outward part,","value":1},
		{"name":"And my heart's right, thy inward love of heart.","value":1},
		{"name":"Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took,","value":1},
		{"name":"And each doth good turns now unto the other:","value":1},
		{"name":"When that mine eye is famish'd for a look,","value":1},
		{"name":"Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother,","value":1},
		{"name":"With my love's picture then my eye doth feast,","value":1},
		{"name":"And to the painted banquet bids my heart;","value":1},
		{"name":"Another time mine eye is my heart's guest,","value":1},
		{"name":"And in his thoughts of love doth share a part:","value":1},
		{"name":"So, either by thy picture or my love,","value":1},
		{"name":"Thy self away, art present still with me;","value":1},
		{"name":"For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move,","value":1},
		{"name":"And I am still with them, and they with thee;","value":1},
		{"name":"Or, if they sleep, thy picture in my sight","value":1},
		{"name":"Awakes my heart, to heart's and eye's delight.","value":1},
		{"name":"How careful was I when I took my way,","value":1},
		{"name":"Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,","value":1},
		{"name":"That to my use it might unused stay","value":1},
		{"name":"From hands of falsehood, in sure wards of trust!","value":1},

		{"name":"Most worthy comfort, now my greatest grief,","value":1},
		{"name":"Thou best of dearest, and mine only care,","value":1},
		{"name":"Art left the prey of every vulgar thief. ","value":1},
		{"name":"Thee have I not lock'd up in any chest,","value":1},
		{"name":"Save where thou art not, though I feel thou art,","value":1},
		{"name":"Within the gentle closure of my breast,","value":1},
		{"name":"From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part;","value":1},
		{"name":"And even thence thou wilt be stol'n I fear,","value":1},
		{"name":"For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear.","value":1},
		{"name":"Against that time, if ever that time come,","value":1},
		{"name":"When I shall see thee frown on my defects,","value":1},
		{"name":"When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum,","value":1},
		{"name":"Call'd to that audit by advis'd respects;","value":1},
		{"name":"Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass,","value":1},
		{"name":"And scarcely greet me with that sun, thine eye,","value":1},
		{"name":"When love, converted from the thing it was,","value":1},
		{"name":"Shall reasons find of settled gravity;","value":1},
		{"name":"Against that time do I ensconce me here,","value":1},
		{"name":"Within the knowledge of mine own desert,","value":1},
		{"name":"And this my hand, against my self uprear,","value":1},
		{"name":"To guard the lawful reasons on thy part: ","value":1},
		{"name":"To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws,","value":1},
		{"name":"Since why to love I can allege no cause.","value":1},
		{"name":"How heavy do I journey on the way,","value":1},
		{"name":"When what I seek, my weary travel's end,","value":1},
		{"name":"Doth teach that ease and that repose to say,","value":1},
		{"name":"'Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend!'","value":1},
		{"name":"The beast that bears me, tired with my woe,","value":1},
		{"name":"Plods dully on, to bear that weight in me,","value":1},
		{"name":"As if by some instinct the wretch did know","value":1},
		{"name":"His rider lov'd not speed, being made from thee:","value":1},
		{"name":"The bloody spur cannot provoke him on,","value":1},
		{"name":"That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide,","value":1},
		{"name":"Which heavily he answers with a groan,","value":1},
		{"name":"More sharp to me than spurring to his side;","value":1},
		{"name":"For that same groan doth put this in my mind,","value":1},
		{"name":"My grief lies onward, and my joy behind.","value":1},
		{"name":"Thus can my love excuse the slow offence","value":1},
		{"name":"Of my dull bearer when from thee I speed:","value":1},
		{"name":"From where thou art why should I haste me thence?","value":1},
		{"name":"Till I return, of posting is no need.","value":1},
		{"name":"O! what excuse will my poor beast then find,","value":1},
		{"name":"When swift extremity can seem but slow?","value":1},
		{"name":"Then should I spur, though mounted on the wind,","value":1},
		{"name":"In winged speed no motion shall I know,","value":1},
		{"name":"Then can no horse with my desire keep pace;","value":1},
		{"name":"Therefore desire, of perfect'st love being made,","value":1},
		{"name":"Shall neigh--no dull flesh--in his fiery race;","value":1},
		{"name":"But love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade,--","value":1},
		{"name":"'Since from thee going, he went wilful-slow,","value":1},
		{"name":"Towards thee I'll run, and give him leave to go.'","value":1},
		{"name":"So am I as the rich, whose blessed key,","value":1},
		{"name":"Can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure,","value":1},
		{"name":"The which he will not every hour survey,","value":1},
		{"name":"For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure. ","value":1},
		{"name":"Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare,","value":1},
		{"name":"Since, seldom coming in that long year set,","value":1},
		{"name":"Like stones of worth they thinly placed are,","value":1},
		{"name":"Or captain jewels in the carcanet.","value":1},
		{"name":"So is the time that keeps you as my chest,","value":1},
		{"name":"Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide,","value":1},
		{"name":"To make some special instant special-blest,","value":1},
		{"name":"By new unfolding his imprison'd pride.","value":1},
		{"name":"Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope,","value":1},
		{"name":"Being had, to triumph; being lacked, to hope.","value":1},
		{"name":"What is your substance, whereof are you made,","value":1},
		{"name":"That millions of strange shadows on you tend?","value":1},

		{"name":"By that sweet ornament which truth doth give.","value":1},
		{"name":"The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem","value":1},
		{"name":"For that sweet odour, which doth in it live.","value":1},
		{"name":"The canker blooms have full as deep a dye","value":1},
		{"name":"As the perfumed tincture of the roses.","value":1},
		{"name":"Hang on such thorns, and play as wantonly","value":1},
		{"name":"When summer's breath their masked buds discloses:","value":1},

		{"name":"And yet this time removed was summer's time;","value":1},
		{"name":"The teeming autumn, big with rich increase,","value":1},
		{"name":"Bearing the wanton burden of the prime,","value":1},
		{"name":"Like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease:","value":1},

		{"name":"When proud-pied April, dress'd in all his trim,","value":1},
		{"name":"Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing,","value":1},
		{"name":"That heavy Saturn laugh'd and leap'd with him.","value":1},
		{"name":"Yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell","value":1},
		{"name":"Of different flowers in odour and in hue,","value":1},
		{"name":"Could make me any summer's story tell,","value":1},
		{"name":"Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew: ","value":1},
		{"name":"Nor did I wonder at the lily's white,","value":1},
		{"name":"Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose;","value":1},
		{"name":"They were but sweet, but figures of delight,","value":1},
		{"name":"Drawn after you, you pattern of all those.","value":1},
		{"name":"Yet seem'd it winter still, and you away,","value":1},
		{"name":"As with your shadow I with these did play.","value":1},
		{"name":"The forward violet thus did I chide:","value":1},
		{"name":"Sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells,","value":1},
		{"name":"If not from my love's breath? The purple pride","value":1},
		{"name":"Which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells","value":1},
		{"name":"In my love's veins thou hast too grossly dy'd.","value":1},
		{"name":"The lily I condemned for thy hand,","value":1},
		{"name":"And buds of marjoram had stol'n thy hair;","value":1},
		{"name":"The roses fearfully on thorns did stand,","value":1},
		{"name":"One blushing shame, another white despair;","value":1},
		{"name":"A third, nor red nor white, had stol'n of both,","value":1},
		{"name":"And to his robbery had annex'd thy breath;","value":1},
		{"name":"But, for his theft, in pride of all his growth ","value":1},
		{"name":"A vengeful canker eat him up to death.","value":1},
		{"name":"More flowers I noted, yet I none could see,","value":1},
		{"name":"But sweet, or colour it had stol'n from thee.","value":1},
		{"name":"Where art thou Muse that thou forget'st so long,","value":1},
		{"name":"To speak of that which gives thee all thy might?","value":1},
		{"name":"Spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song,","value":1},
		{"name":"Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light?","value":1},
		{"name":"Return forgetful Muse, and straight redeem,","value":1},
		{"name":"In gentle numbers time so idly spent;","value":1},
		{"name":"Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem","value":1},
		{"name":"And gives thy pen both skill and argument.","value":1},
		{"name":"Rise, resty Muse, my love's sweet face survey,","value":1},
		{"name":"If Time have any wrinkle graven there;","value":1},
		{"name":"If any, be a satire to decay,","value":1},
		{"name":"And make time's spoils despised every where.","value":1},
		{"name":"Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life,","value":1},
		{"name":"So thou prevent'st his scythe and crooked knife.","value":1},
		{"name":"O truant Muse what shall be thy amends","value":1},
		{"name":"For thy neglect of truth in beauty dy'd?","value":1},
		{"name":"Both truth and beauty on my love depends;","value":1},
		{"name":"So dost thou too, and therein dignified.","value":1},
		{"name":"Make answer Muse: wilt thou not haply say,","value":1},
		{"name":"'Truth needs no colour, with his colour fix'd;","value":1},
		{"name":"Beauty no pencil, beauty's truth to lay;","value":1},
		{"name":"But best is best, if never intermix'd'?","value":1},
		{"name":"Because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?","value":1},
		{"name":"Excuse not silence so, for't lies in thee","value":1},
		{"name":"To make him much outlive a gilded tomb","value":1},
		{"name":"And to be prais'd of ages yet to be.","value":1},
		{"name":"Then do thy office, Muse; I teach thee how","value":1},
		{"name":"To make him seem long hence as he shows now.","value":1},
		{"name":"My love is strengthen'd, though more weak in seeming;","value":1},
		{"name":"I love not less, though less the show appear;","value":1},
		{"name":"That love is merchandiz'd, whose rich esteeming,","value":1},
		{"name":"The owner's tongue doth publish every where.","value":1},
		{"name":"Our love was new, and then but in the spring,","value":1},
		{"name":"When I was wont to greet it with my lays;","value":1},
		{"name":"As Philomel in summer's front doth sing,","value":1},
		{"name":"And stops her pipe in growth of riper days:","value":1},
		{"name":"Not that the summer is less pleasant now","value":1},
		{"name":"Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night,","value":1},
		{"name":"But that wild music burthens every bough,","value":1},
		{"name":"And sweets grown common lose their dear delight.","value":1},
		{"name":"Therefore like her, I sometime hold my tongue:","value":1},
		{"name":"Because I would not dull you with my song.","value":1},
		{"name":"Alack! what poverty my Muse brings forth,","value":1},
		{"name":"That having such a scope to show her pride,","value":1},
		{"name":"The argument, all bare, is of more worth","value":1},
		{"name":"Than when it hath my added praise beside!","value":1},
		{"name":"O! blame me not, if I no more can write!","value":1},
		{"name":"Look in your glass, and there appears a face","value":1},
		{"name":"That over-goes my blunt invention quite, ","value":1},
		{"name":"Dulling my lines, and doing me disgrace.","value":1},
		{"name":"Were it not sinful then, striving to mend,","value":1},
		{"name":"To mar the subject that before was well?","value":1},
		{"name":"For to no other pass my verses tend","value":1},
		{"name":"Than of your graces and your gifts to tell;","value":1},
		{"name":"And more, much more, than in my verse can sit,","value":1},
		{"name":"Your own glass shows you when you look in it.","value":1},
		{"name":"To me, fair friend, you never can be old,","value":1},
		{"name":"For as you were when first your eye I ey'd,","value":1},
		{"name":"Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold,","value":1},
		{"name":"Have from the forests shook three summers' pride,","value":1},
		{"name":"Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn'd,","value":1},
		{"name":"In process of the seasons have I seen,","value":1},
		{"name":"Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burn'd,","value":1},
		{"name":"Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green.","value":1},
		{"name":"Ah! yet doth beauty like a dial-hand,","value":1},
		{"name":"Steal from his figure, and no pace perceiv'd;","value":1},
		{"name":"So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand,","value":1},
		{"name":"Hath motion, and mine eye may be deceiv'd:","value":1},
		{"name":"For fear of which, hear this thou age unbred:","value":1},
		{"name":"Ere you were born was beauty's summer dead.","value":1},
		{"name":"Let not my love be call'd idolatry,","value":1},
		{"name":"Nor my beloved as an idol show,","value":1},
		{"name":"Since all alike my songs and praises be","value":1},
		{"name":"To one, of one, still such, and ever so.","value":1},
		{"name":"Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,","value":1},
		{"name":"Still constant in a wondrous excellence;","value":1},
		{"name":"Therefore my verse to constancy confin'd,","value":1},
		{"name":"One thing expressing, leaves out difference.","value":1},
		{"name":"'Fair, kind, and true,' is all my argument,","value":1},
		{"name":"'Fair, kind, and true,' varying to other words;","value":1},
		{"name":"And in this change is my invention spent,","value":1},
		{"name":"Three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords.","value":1},
		{"name":"Fair, kind, and true, have often liv'd alone,","value":1},
		{"name":"Which three till now, never kept seat in one.","value":1},
		{"name":"When in the chronicle of wasted time","value":1},
		{"name":"I see descriptions of the fairest wights,","value":1},
		{"name":"And beauty making beautiful old rime,","value":1},
		{"name":"In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights,","value":1},
		{"name":"Then, in the blazon of sweet beauty's best,","value":1},
		{"name":"Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,","value":1},
		{"name":"I see their antique pen would have express'd","value":1},
		{"name":"Even such a beauty as you master now.","value":1},
		{"name":"So all their praises are but prophecies","value":1},
		{"name":"Of this our time, all you prefiguring;","value":1},
		{"name":"And for they looked but with divining eyes,","value":1},
		{"name":"They had not skill enough your worth to sing:","value":1},
		{"name":"For we, which now behold these present days,","value":1},
		{"name":"Have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.","value":1},
		{"name":"Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul","value":1},
		{"name":"Of the wide world dreaming on things to come,","value":1},
		{"name":"Can yet the lease of my true love control, ","value":1},
		{"name":"Supposed as forfeit to a confin'd doom.","value":1},
		{"name":"The mortal moon hath her eclipse endur'd,","value":1},
		{"name":"And the sad augurs mock their own presage;","value":1},
		{"name":"Incertainties now crown themselves assur'd,","value":1},
		{"name":"And peace proclaims olives of endless age.","value":1},
		{"name":"Now with the drops of this most balmy time,","value":1},
		{"name":"My love looks fresh, and Death to me subscribes,","value":1},
		{"name":"Since, spite of him, I'll live in this poor rime,","value":1},
		{"name":"While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes:","value":1},
		{"name":"And thou in this shalt find thy monument,","value":1},
		{"name":"When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent.","value":1},
		{"name":"What's in the brain, that ink may character,","value":1},
		{"name":"Which hath not figur'd to thee my true spirit?","value":1},
		{"name":"What's new to speak, what now to register,","value":1},
		{"name":"That may express my love, or thy dear merit?","value":1},
		{"name":"Nothing, sweet boy; but yet, like prayers divine,","value":1},
		{"name":"I must each day say o'er the very same;","value":1},
		{"name":"Counting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine, ","value":1},
		{"name":"Even as when first I hallow'd thy fair name.","value":1},
		{"name":"So that eternal love in love's fresh case,","value":1},
		{"name":"Weighs not the dust and injury of age,","value":1},
		{"name":"Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,","value":1},
		{"name":"But makes antiquity for aye his page;","value":1},
		{"name":"Finding the first conceit of love there bred,","value":1},
		{"name":"Where time and outward form would show it dead.","value":1},
		{"name":"O! never say that I was false of heart,","value":1},
		{"name":"Though absence seem'd my flame to qualify,","value":1},
		{"name":"As easy might I from my self depart","value":1},
		{"name":"As from my soul which in thy breast doth lie:","value":1},
		{"name":"That is my home of love: if I have rang'd,","value":1},
		{"name":"Like him that travels, I return again;","value":1},
		{"name":"Just to the time, not with the time exchang'd,","value":1},
		{"name":"So that myself bring water for my stain.","value":1},
